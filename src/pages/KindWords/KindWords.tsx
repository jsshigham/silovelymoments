Her warmth and kindness put us at ease immediately, and that made the whole experience so much more relaxed and enjoyable. Our family at the elopement have not stopped raving about how much they loved her too. You can tell she truly cares! She has an incredible talent for making you feel comfortable in front of the camera, and she has such a natural ability to capture those authentic, intimate moments.. Every photo feels so personal, like she was able to see and capture the essence of us as a couple. We were seriously so amazed at how many beautiful shots she managed to get, and weâ€™ve received endless compliments from friends and family about how stunning the photos turned out. She was quick, professional, and SO TALENTED. We are absolutely obsessed with the photos she captured. If you're looking for someone who is not only a talented photographer but also a kind and genuine person who truly cares about your story, we cannot recommend Siera enough. She made our day even more special. I would give her a million stars if I could!!`,
